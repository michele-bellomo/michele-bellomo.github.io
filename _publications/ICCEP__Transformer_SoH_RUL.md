In this article, we introduce an innovative approach based on the Transformer neural network architecture for future state of health (SoH) trajectory prediction and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation in lithium-ion batteries. In this methodology, the same model handles predictions for both early and late cycles, thanks to intelligent management of variable-length input and output sequences. Additionally, the future SoH curve is obtained through a one-shot multistep (OSMS) prediction, which enables faster predictions and fewer accumulated errors compared to the standard autoregressive approach. We tested this model on the PoliMi-TUB battery dataset, achieving better results than previous models based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
