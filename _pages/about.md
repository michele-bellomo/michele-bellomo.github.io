I am a Mathematical Engineer and a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, Italy. 
My research spans both methodological and applied aspects of mathematical modeling, optimization, statistics, machine learning and deep learning, with a focus on applications in finance, healthcare and the energy sector.

The purpose of this website is to present **a selection of my publications**, which can be found in the [Publications]({{ "/publications/" | relative_url }}) section.
